    <p><img src = "pics/naan.jpg", alt = "Tasty looking Butter naan"></p>
    <p>This is an authentic Indian Naan recipe. I have made this many times. It goes well with Indian curry which has a lot of gravy, 
        such as the Butter Chicken. Click <a href = "recipes/naan.html" target = "_blank">here</a> to go to the recipe!
